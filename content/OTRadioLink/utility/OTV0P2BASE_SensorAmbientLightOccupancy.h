// Helper class to detect occupancy from ambient light levels.
//
// See research in this field such as:
//     "An intelligent agent for determining home occupancy using power monitors and light sensors"
//     https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225132826_An_Intelligent_Agent_for_Determining_Home_Occupancy_Using_Power_Monitors_and_Light_Sensors
//     Determining occupancy by ambient light sensors yielded an f-score
//     of 0.943 (precision score of 0.926, recall score of 0.962).
//     This did work very well. A more detailed examination found
//     there were 19 out of 219 days where the dayâ€™s precision or
//     recall scores were below 80% due to unusual light levels and sensors
//     not being optimally placed ...
//
// The basic mode of operation is to call update() regularly
// (typically once per minute)
// with the current ambient light level.
//
// If occupancy is detected then update() returns true.
//
// Generally the initial call to update() should not return true,
// whatever the indicate current light level,
// to avoid spurious occupancy detection at power-up/restart.
//
// The class retains state in order to detect occupancy.
//
// A light level of 0 indicates dark.
//
// A light level of 254 (or over) indicates bright/full illumination.
//
// Light levels should be monotonic with lux.
//
// The more linear relationship between lux and the light level
// in the typical region of operation nominally the better,
// but in practice covering the range if illuminations in a typical
// home probably requires a fair amount of non-linearity,
// so a pure log response may also work well.
