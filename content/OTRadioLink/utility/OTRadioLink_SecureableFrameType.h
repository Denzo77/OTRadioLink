/* LIBRARY INTERDEPENDENCY POLICY FOR CRYPTO AND SECURE FRAMES

DHD20160106

I have been deciding how best to get at the encryption needed for secure frame support in
OTRadioLink/BASELIB without making the OTAESGCM and OTRadioLink libraries interdependent.

In particular I want to keep OTAESGCM as lightweight as possible and in no way dependent
on our V0p2 hardware support for example.

I also don’t want to force occasional developers against V0P2 code to load up lots of code
and libs that they may not even need (eg OTAESGCM) in some kind of DLL hell equivalent.

I propose to require pointers to enc/dec routines with the right signature to be made available
at run-time to the OTRadioLink frame RX/TX support routines, which means that only the top level
code that needs the secure frame functionality need link in the OTAESGCM lib, and other apps
get no dependency.  (Note, I’m relying on C++ type safety on signatures here ideally,
to completely minimise mutual dependencies, though there’s still the issue of retained/opaque
state to deal with, etc, etc.)

It also means that different enc/auth mechanisms can be selected at run-time or compile-time.
