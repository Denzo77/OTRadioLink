    // In a basic binary "bang-bang" mode the valve is operated fully on or off.
    // This may make sense where, for example, the radiator is instant electric.
    // The top of the central range is as for proportional,
    // and the bottom of the central range is 1C or 2C below.
    //
    // Basic strategy for proportional control:
    //   * The aim is to stay within and at the top end of the 'target' 1C band.
    //   * The target 1C band is offset so that at a nominal XC.
    //     temperature should be held somewhere between X.0C and X.5C.
    //   * There is an outer band which when left has the valve immediately
    //     completely opens or shuts as in binary mode, as an end stop on
    //     behaviour.
    //   * The outer band is wide, even without a wide deadband,
    //     to allow the valve not necessarily to be immediately pushed
    //     to end stops even when switching between setback levels,
    //     and to allow temporary overshoot when the temperature sensor
    //     is close to the heater for all-in-one TRVs for example.
    //   * When dark or unoccupied or otherwise needing to be quiet
    //     the temperature is allowed to drift in a somewhat wider band
    //     to reduce valve movement and noise (and battery consumption)
    //     and boiler running and energy consumption and noise.
    //   * When the device sees rapid temperature movements,
    //     eg for an all-in-one TRV mounted on the radiator,
    //     temporarily larger excursions are allowed.
    //   * To save noise and battery life, and help avoid valve sticking,
    //     the valve will lazily try to avoid unnecessary movement,
    //     and avoid running further or faster than necessary.
    //   * The valve will try to avoid calling for heat from the boiler
    //     without being open enough to allow decent flow.
    //   * The valve will try to avoid calling for heat indefinitely
    //     with the valve static.  (TODO-1096)
    //   * The valve may be held open without calling for heat
    //     to help quietly scavenge heat if the boiler is already running.
    //   * The valve will attempt to respond rapidly to (eg) manual controls
    //     and new room occupancy.
    //
    // More detail:
    //   * There is a 'sweet-spot' 0.5C wide in the target 1C;
    //     wider but at the same centre with a wide deadband requested.
    //   * Providing that there is no call for heat
    //     then the valve can rest indefinitely at or close to the sweet-spot
    //     ie avoid movement.
    //   * Outside the sweet-spot the valve will always try to seek back to it,
    //     either passively if the temperature is moving in the right direction,
    //     or actively by adjusting the valve.
    //   * Valve movement may be faster the further from the target/sweet-spot.
    //   * The valve can be run in a glacial mode,
    //     where the valve will always adjust at minimum speed,
    //     to minimise flow eg where there is a charge by volume.
    //   * In order to allow for valves only open enough at/near 100%,
    //     and to reduce battery drain and valve wear/sticking,
    //     the algorithm is biased towards fully opening but not fully closing.
